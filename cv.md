My goal is to do what I like to do, which is programming. I have loved computer science since childhood, but it was only as an adult, to my great regret, that I began to think that I wanted to devote most of my time to it. I have no experience in programming areas so far, but soon I am sure this will change, because I am quick learner and really love this! 
My skills: IDE(XCode), Swift, SwiftUI, entry-level knowledge of the Git, a basic level of knowledge in some design patterns(MVC, MVVM) 
My GitHub with some source code: https://github.com/MilezKilo 
At the moment there is no work experience, except pet projects 
Higher management education 
English level is B1
